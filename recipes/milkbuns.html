    <h1>Milk Buns</h2>
        <img src="../img/milkbuns.JPG" alt="Photo of freshly baked milk buns" width="400" height="600">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This receipe is based on Japanese Hokkaido milk bread and is my new favorite receipe for sandwich buns.</p>
            <p>These buns aren't limited to just sandwiches.  They make for a great dinner roll, or a quick snack with peanut butter or jam.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Roux</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>43g water</li>
                <li>43g whole milk</li>
                <li>14g bread flour</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Dough</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>300g bread flour</li>
                <li>14g nonfat dry milk</li>
                <li>50g granulated sugar</li>
                <li>6g salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
                <li>113g whole milk plus additional for wash</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>57g unsalted room temperature butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the roux ingredients in a small sauce pan.  Whisk until no lumps remain</li>
                <li>Place the saucepan over low heat and cook, continuously whisking, until thickened.  Transfer into a bowl and place in refridgerator to cool 10-15 mins</li>
                <li>While the roux is cooling, begin to make the dough.  Mix the bread flour, dry milk, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl or stand mixer bowl</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the whole milk, egg, and cooled roux.  Once combined, mix into the dry ingredients</li>
                <li>Knead by hand or using a dough hook attachment on a stand mixer.  The dough will be sticky.  Avoid the urge to add more flour</li>
                <li>Use the <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/10/14/what-is-the-windowpane-test-for-bread-dough#:~:text=The%20windowpane%20test%20lets%20you,stretch%20it%20much%20more%20thinly.">Window Pane Test</a> to help determine when the dough had been properly kneaded.  Once satisfactory, mix in the butter</li>
                <li>Shape the dough into a ball and let proof in a lightly greased bowl until puffy, but not necessarily doubled in size</li>
                <li>Once proofed, deflate and divide into portions of 92-97 grams each and gently shape into balls.  Transfer to a parchment lined baking tray, keeping 3-4 inches between dough balls</li>
                <li>Brush tops of dough balls with remaining whole milk and let sit 30-40 minutes.  While buns rest, preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit</li>
                <li>Bake until dark golden brown on top, 25-30 minutes.  Let cool on tray for about 10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack</li>
