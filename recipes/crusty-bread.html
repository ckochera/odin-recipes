        <p>This is a classic no-knead bread recipe that is sure to impress your taste buds.  Even more impressive is the small amount of work that results in huge taste.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul class="ingredientUL">
    <li>500 grams white bread flour</li>
    <li>380 grams water, approximately 90-97 degrees Farenheit</li>
    <li>11 grams salt (I like to use Kosher salt)</li>
    <li>0.4 grams active dry yeast</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="steps-container">
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol class="stepsOL">
    <li>Start with the bread flour in a large bowl.  Pour the water on top and use your hands to combine</li>
    <li>Start a timer for 20-25 minutes and let the flour hydrate</li>
    <li>Once the flour has been hydrated, pour the salt and yeast on top of the mixture</li>
    <li>Combine using <a href="https://sunriseflourmill.com/blogs/news/pincer-method">the Pincer method</a></li>
    <li>The bread will need 3-4 folds in the time directly after mixing. If you are unfamiliar with folding, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbJWVvod13k&ab_channel=KenForkish">here is a good video</a></li>
    <li>Cover the bowl and let rise 12 hours</li>
</ol>
<h4>After the bread has risen...</h4>
<ol class="stepsOL">
    <li>Place a dutch oven inside your oven and preheat to 475 degrees Farenheit</li>
    <li>Gently dump the bread dough onto a floured surface and shape into a ball</li>
    <li>Place the ball into a proofing basket and let proof for approximately an hour</li>
    <li>Once proofed, place the dough ball into the dutch oven.  Take care as the dutch oven will be very hot</li>
    <li>Bake for 30 minutes covered, then remove the dutch oven lid and bake for 10-20 minutes, until the surface of the bread is golden brown</li>
    <li>Remove from dutch oven and let cool on a wire rack for at least 45 minutes</li>
</ol>
